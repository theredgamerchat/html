            <h1>article on youtube</h1>
            <p>YouTube, social media platform and website for sharing videos. It was registered on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and <br>
                Jawed Karim, three former employees of the American e-commerce company PayPal. They had the idea that ordinary people would enjoy sharing <br>
                their “home videos.” The company is headquartered in San Bruno, California. Shortly after the site opened on a limited (“beta”) basis <br>
                in May 2005, it was attracting some 30,000 visitors per day. By the time YouTube was officially launched on December 15, 2005, it was 
                <br> serving more than two million video views each day. By January 2006 that number had increased to more than 25 million views. <br>
                The number of videos available at the site surpassed 25 million in March 2006, with more than 20,000 new videos uploaded on a daily<br> 
                basis. By the summer of 2006, YouTube was serving more than 100 million videos per day, and the number of videos being uploaded to the <br>
                site showed no sign of slowing down. The immense growth in traffic at YouTube created its own set of problems. The company continually <br>
                had to purchase more computer equipment and more broadband connections to the Internet. In addition, YouTube was forced to allocate more<br> 
                financial resources for potential litigation, as many media companies discovered that some of the videos uploaded to YouTube contained <br>
                copyrighted material. With limited success in commercializing its Web site or containing its growing costs, YouTube began looking for a buyer.<br>
                In 2005 the American search engine company Google Inc. had launched a video service, Google Video, but it failed to generate much traffic, and <br>
                Google was prompted to purchase YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock in November 2006. Rather than merging the Web sites, however, Google continued <br>
                YouTube’s operation as before. To reduce the risk of copyright-infringement lawsuits, Google negotiated deals with a number of entertainment companies<br>
                 that would allow copyrighted video material to appear on YouTube and would give YouTube users the right to include certain copyrighted songs in their videos. <br>
                 It also agreed to remove tens of thousands of copyrighted video files from YouTube. In November 2008 Google reached an agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (MGM),<br>
                  to show some of the studio’s full-length movies and television shows, the broadcasts being free to watch, with advertisements running alongside the programs.</p>
