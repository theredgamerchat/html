<p><blockquote><abbr title="st">skibidi toilet</abbr> is an animated web series of YouTube videos and shorts created by Alexey Gerasimov and uploaded on his YouTube channel <q>DaFu!?Boom!</q>. Produced using Source Filmmaker, the series follows a fictional war between human-headed toilets and humanoid characters with electronic devices for heads. Since the first short was posted in February 2023, Skibidi Toilet has become viral as an internet meme across various social media platforms, particularly among younger Generation Alphas. Critics saw the series as Generation Alpha's first foray into internet culture, competing with the older Generation Z.

    Plot and characteristics
    The dialogue-free[1] series depicts a conflict between singing human-headed toilets—the titular "Skibidi Toilets"—and humanoids with CCTV cameras, speakers, and televisions in place of their heads. In a New York City-esque setting, the Skibidi Toilets, and their leader G-Man, threaten humanity. Two types of humanoids, cameramen and speakermen, form an alliance against the toilets. Each has one of its kind that is much larger than the rest, termed "titans". A toilet parasite infects Speaker Titan, leading to casualties. Later in the series, TV-headed humanoids and their titan are introduced, and with their help, the speaker titan is broken free from mind control. The battle spreads to other cities, where the titans destroy what seems to be the G-Man, but it turns out to be a fake. The titans convene and seems to defeat the mastermind, the Scientist Toilet, but once again are fooled by a decoy. The true Scientist Toilet is revealed to be in hiding.
    
    Business Insider described the series as "an endless arms race as both the toilets and their foes [produce] stronger fighters".[2] A mashup of the songs "Give It to Me" by Timbaland[3] and "Dom Dom Yes Yes" by Biser King",[4] created by TikTok user @doombreaker03,[5] appears in each episode as the theme of the Skibidi Toilets, and is the origin of the name Skibidi.[3] "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears is featured in some videos as the theme of the camera-head resistance.[2]
    
    The show contains references to video games, such as the character G-Man, whose name comes from the Half-Life video game series, and the dances performed by the Cameramen are inspired by emotes from the online battle royale game, Fortnite.[3]
    
    Background and production
    Skibidi Toilet is produced by Alexey Gerasimov (born 1997 or 1998),[3] also known as "DaFuq!?Boom!" and "Blugray".[6] Since 2014, he has been learning animation on his own. He lives in the country of Georgia.[6] His channel has seen prior hits; his video I'M AT DIP accumulated over 45 million views by July 2023.[6]
    
    First released in February 2023,[7] every episode is produced using Source Filmmaker, a free Valve-published 3D computer graphics software, often used to create and edit clips and movies online.[8] Some assets used in the series are taken from video games such as Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source.[9] In 2022, the song "Dom Dom Yes Yes" by Biser King became a TikTok meme.[8][9] Another TikTok user, Paryss Bryanne, in turn, parodied this meme, complementing it with her style of jerky acting with rapid cuts. Alexey cites her adaptation as one of the inspirations for Skibidi Toilet.[9]
    
    Reception and influence
    Popularity
    Skibidi Toilet's audience is predominantly among Generation Alpha, born in 2012 or later. While the series does not appear in YouTube Kids, an app designed for children under the age of 13, it still enjoys popularity among elementary students.[3] Skibidi Toilet has sparked its audience to create and post fanworks, such as games, fan fiction, and art,[3] as well as the Generation Alpha slang "skibidi".[10]
    
    As of November 2023, YouTube videos associated with Skibidi Toilet accumulated over 65 billion views, while on the social media platform TikTok, the "Skibidi Toilet" hashtag is trending and comprises 15.3 billion views. By December, the channel "DaFuq!?Boom!" had amassed 37 million subscribers, experiencing such rapid growth that, on occasion, had surpassed those of MrBeast, the second most subscribed channel of YouTube. The series has found its way into internet memes and Instagram videos. The Washington Post went as far as to call it "the biggest online phenomenon of the year."[3]
    
    According to Tubefilter rankings, by the end of April 2023, "DaFuq!?Boom!" entered the fifty most viewed YouTube channels in the United States, at 33rd place.[11] By June, the channel had achieved a milestone of five billion views,[12] making it the most viewed YouTube channel in the US during that month.[13] The editor, Sam Gutelle, noted that previously, the channel existed largely under the radar, except for a few "animation diehards in the meme community".[14] Daily Dot's offshoot publication Passionfruit suspected the popularity of the series was due to how the "designs combined a simple, cute style with more uncanny elements", citing other popular characters like Sans and Siren Head.[5]
    
    Critical reception
    The lifestyle magazine Dazed characterized Skibidi Toilet as "frenetic, unpredictable, funny and at times genuinely unsettling".[8] Yahoo's In The Know compared the animation style to that of a mobile game, describing it as having "choppy movements and exaggerated facial expressions".[7] Cartoon Brew, an animation-focused website, stated that while Skibidi Toilet "may look rough around the edges compared to major studio fare [...] there is no question that Gerasimov is a filmmaker who understands pacing, camerawork, sound design, and how to tell a story."[6]
    
    Many publications highlighted a viral tweet, in which user @AnimeSerbia called the series Generation Alpha's Slender Man.[8][9] Insider claimed the series exemplified the start of a new generation gaining prominence, using the relationship between millennials and Gen Z as an example,[15] a stance that Indy100 repeated, who commented that "[Gen Z] will be facing the same mocking and ridicule they dished out to Millennials."[16] News.com.au opined "[the series] is a timely reminder that Gen Alpha are on the horizon".[17]
    
    The Washington Post noted the series' uniqueness in creating a narrative entirely out of short-form videos, and remarked on YouTube's ability to stay relevant while competing with TikTok.[3] Adam Bumas, in a guest piece for Ryan Broderick's newsletter, Garbage Day, remarked the series leans into "weird internet aesthetics", creating a nostalgic element.[18] Business Insider echoed this, remarking on the series' use of old video game assets.[2]
    
    Several parental websites[3] and Indonesian newspapers[1][19][20] claimed that Skibidi Toilet's violence and bizarre visuals may have a harmful effect for young children, dubbing it "Skibidi Toilet Syndrome" (Indonesian: Sindrom Skibidi Toilet). Viral videos have surfaced where children sit inside various containers and mimic the toilets.[3]</blockquote><p>
