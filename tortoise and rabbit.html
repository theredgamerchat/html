<h1>The Hare and the Tortoise</h1>
<p> One day, <b>a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run.</b> He was laughing at the turtle for being so slow. <br>
    Much to the rabbit's surprise,</p>
    <h2>The challange</h2>
    <p> <i>the turtle challenged him to a race.</i> The rabbit thought this was a good joke and <br>
    accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the umpire of the race. </p>
    <h2>The race began</h2>
    <p>As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle, <br>just like everyone thought. The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere. He was hot and tired<br> 
    and decided to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the finish line ahead of him.<br> 
    All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just kept going. <br>
    However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He could not see the turtle anywhere! He went at full speed to the finish line <br>
    <h2>who won ?</h2>
    but found the turtle there waiting for him. The moral of the story is that one should never underestimate the weakest opponent. </p>
